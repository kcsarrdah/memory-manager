# MemoryPool: A Custom C++ Memory Manager

## Overview
The `MemoryPool` class is a custom memory manager that enables efficient, manually controlled memory allocation and deallocation, tailored for performance-sensitive applications that require fine-grained memory management. This memory pool avoids system-level allocation overhead by managing a pre-allocated block of memory internally.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Growth**: Ability to grow the pool up to a specified maximum size
- **Thread Safety**: Built-in thread-safe operations using mutex locks
- **Alignment Control**: Allocations can be aligned to user-specified boundaries
- **Defragmentation**: Automatic coalescing of adjacent free blocks
- **Memory Tracking**: Basic memory usage tracking through getUsedSize() and getFreeSize()
- **Smart Pointer Management**: Uses smart pointers for additional memory pools

## How It Works
1. **Pre-allocated Memory**: Initializes with a specified size and optional maximum growth limit
2. **Block Management**: Manages memory in blocks with metadata (size, usage, alignment)
3. **Dynamic Growth**: Grows automatically when needed, up to the specified maximum
4. **Thread Safety**: All operations are protected with mutex locks
5. **Defragmentation**: Automatically merges adjacent free blocks

## Installation

### Build Requirements

1. CMake (3.15 or higher)
2. C++17 compatible compiler
3. Google Test (automatically fetched by CMake)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your_repository_url>
cd memory-pool-library
```

### Using with an IDE (e.g., CLion, Visual Studio Code)
1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Set up CMake: Ensure CMake is installed and configured in your IDE (most C++ IDEs have built-in CMake support).
3. Add Tests: Tests are provided in the tests folder using Google Test.
4. Build and Run: Build the project, and you can run the tests to verify functionality.

### Using from Command Line

1. **Install CMake and Google Test**:
   * Ensure CMake is installed on your system.
   * Clone and install Google Test (if itâ€™s not available in your environment).
2. **Build the Library**:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
3. **Run Tests:**
`./tests/MemoryPoolTest`

## Usage

### Initialize the MemoryPool:
```c++
// Create a pool with initial size and maximum size
MemoryPool pool(1024, 2048);  // 1KB initial, 2KB max

// Basic allocation
void* ptr1 = pool.allocate(128);

// Aligned allocation
void* ptr2 = pool.allocate(64, 16);  // 16-byte alignment

// Deallocation
pool.deallocate(ptr1);
pool.deallocate(ptr2);
```
### Allocate and Deallocate Memory:
```c++
void* ptr1 = pool.allocate(128);       // Allocates 128 bytes
void* ptr2 = pool.allocate(64, 16);    // Allocates 64 bytes with 16-byte alignment
pool.deallocate(ptr1);                 // Deallocates 128 bytes
```
### Get Memory Usage:
```c++
size_t used = pool.getUsedSize();
size_t free = pool.getFreeSize();
size_t max = pool.getMaxSize();
```
### Thread-Safe Usage: 
```c++
MemoryPool pool(1024, 2048);

// Can be safely used from multiple threads
std::thread t1([&pool]() {
    void* ptr = pool.allocate(128);
    // Use memory
    pool.deallocate(ptr);
});

std::thread t2([&pool]() {
    void* ptr = pool.allocate(256);
    // Use memory
    pool.deallocate(ptr);
});

t1.join();
t2.join();
```

## Differences from Standard Memory Managers
* **Fixed Size**: The pool has a fixed maximum size, unlike dynamic memory allocation via new or malloc.
* **Custom Defragmentation**: Adjacent blocks are merged when freed, which is typically managed by the OS in standard managers.
* **Manual Control**: Fine-tuned control over block alignment and allocation patterns, which may lead to performance gains in certain use cases.

### Limitations and Considerations

* **Fixed Maximum Size**: While the pool can grow, it has a hard maximum limit
* **Allocation Overhead**: Small allocations have metadata overhead
* **No Shrinking**: The pool cannot shrink after growing
* **Memory Layout**: Consecutive allocations may not be contiguous due to block management


## Future Enhancements
- Performance benchmarking suite for comparing with standard allocators
- Detailed memory usage statistics and monitoring
- Memory pool factory for different size classes
- Serialization/deserialization support
